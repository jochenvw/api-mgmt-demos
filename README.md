# A full practical guide on how to use Azure API Management

## Repo objective
The objective of this repository is to serve as a practical guide on using API Management.
Although the main goal is API-management, we combine it with other tools to give a holistic experience of the Microsoft Platform (i.e. integrate with Github, Bicep Deployments, Monitoring, etc.)

## To get Started:
In order to use this repository, the following files need to be modified.

#### Modify infra/*.bicep files:
api-api.bicep:

        - graphql_api_name

api-apps.bicep:
